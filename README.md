# auth package for golang

## Example

To build and run the example server:

  cd example
  go build ./...
  ./example

Point your browser to localhost:8018 and try the `/open/hello` and
`api/secret` buttons to see how those API calls respond when you are
logged in or logged out.

You can then look at the code in `example.js` to see how to use the
auth package to provide authentication for your simple web app.
